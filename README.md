## How to run?
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Go to the root directory and execute `mvn install` command, then wait until the build succeeds.
3. Start the [Arrowhead Framework v4.1.3](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring), before you would start the demo.
   Required core systems:
   * Service Registry
   * Authorization
   * Orchestration
4. Start the provider (it will registrate automatically to the Service Registry Core System).
5. At the very first time, register the consumer manually and create the intra cloud authorization rules.
6. Start the Consumer.
